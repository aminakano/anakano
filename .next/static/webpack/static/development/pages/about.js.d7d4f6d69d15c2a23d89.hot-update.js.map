I like coding, design and learning new technologies especially JavaScript and its libraries. I used to be a secretary, however, I came up with the idea of using my creativity in my full-time job and devoted myself into a coding bootcamp in Amsterdam, which surely was a fantastic decision. Currently I am working on a beautiful webshop as a full-time Frontend Intern and recently I have got my first freelance project to build a corporate website.\n    </p>\n    <img src={image} />\n    <style jsx>\n      {`\n        .main {\n          width: 100%;\n          height: 92vh;\n          background-color: #d3d3d3;\n          display: flex;\n          flex-direction: column;\n          align-items: center;\n          justify-content: center;\n        }\n        p {\n          font-size: 1.5rem;\n          font-weight: 200;\n          width: 60%;\n          line-height: 1.2;\n        }\n\n        img {\n          border-radius: 50%;\n          width: 14rem;\n          height: 14rem;\n        }\n      `}\n    </style>\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default Layout(Page);\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAJA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA;AACA;AAiCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
